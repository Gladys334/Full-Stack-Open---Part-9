# Full Stack Open - Part 9 (Exercises 9.23–9.30)

This repository contains my solutions for **Part 9 (Patientor App)** of the **University of Helsinki Full Stack Open** course.

I completed these exercises using a **Connex Serenity Tablet 1055**, working directly on GitHub because online editors like StackBlitz, CodeSandbox, and Replit were not accessible.

## 🧩 Exercises Covered
- **9.23–9.27:** Backend (Patientor API built with Express and TypeScript)
- **9.28–9.30:** Frontend (React + TypeScript integration with the backend)
